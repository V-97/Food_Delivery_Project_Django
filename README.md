# Food_Delivery_Project_Django

A food delivery project can involve designing and implementing a system to allow customers to order food online or through a mobile app: 
Online ordering
Customers can browse a restaurant's menu online and place an order. They can choose to pay online or with cash on delivery.

Database management
A database can track restaurants, dishes, delivery employees, customer orders, and deals.
